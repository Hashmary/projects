# Projects

This initiative started with the submissions for the Blockspace Symmetry Hackathon (Aug. 19-12, 2024, Funkhaus, Berlin), whereby 8 submissions were selected to be the ones to receive cash prizes.
The prizes were given in two milestones: 60% given upfront and 40% to be distributed upon the completion of a second milestone.

The repository serves the purpose of confirming the receipt of submitted milestone and to have a central place for all submissions continued to be worked on post-hackathon.
