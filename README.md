# Projects

This initiative started with the submissions for the Blockspace Symmetry Hackathon (Aug. 19-12, 2024, Funkhaus, Berlin), whereby 8 submissions were selected to be the ones to receive cash prizes.
The prizes were given in two milestones: 60% given upfront and 40% to be distributed upon the completion of a second milestone.

The repository serves the purpose of confirming the receipt of submitted milestone and to have a central place for all submissions continued to be worked on post-hackathon.

# Submitting a milestone

2. Go to `app/src/assets` and find your project in the list of submissions (e.g. in "funkhaus-2024.json")
3. Modify the "milestones" filed and add a short description for the milestones you completed.
3. Make a PR to this repo with your changes.
4. Repo maintainers will review your PR and send you the cash prize for the milestone upon approval.
